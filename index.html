    <h1 id="opening"><b> Hi there!!! </b></h1>
    <br />
    <p class="text_box">
        Welcome to my page. I plan for this to serve as a sort of porfolio slash blog for my projects. I'm a math student with an
        interest in programing as well as the sciences. I also have a soft spot for good story telling and strange music though 
        I'm not sure how much I'll be able to express that here.<br>
        So if any of that is of interest to you then please come along for what I hope will be an entertaining and educational 
        expirience for both of us. \(^^)/

    <h1 style="text-align: center;width: 50%;margin: auto;"><b>About Me</b></h1>
    <p class="text_box">
        Like I said before, I'm currently studying mathematical sciences, and while I do want to continue studying maths in the
        future (my particular interest is in differential opperators and Fourier analysis in case anyone was wondering) I also
        have a keen interest in programing. The process of good programing practice and encapsulation is actualy quite close to
        the mathematical approach to solving problems so it is perhaps not so surprising that these two interests overlap. No 
        matter the case I enjoy the problem solving aspect of programing, to me it strikes the perfect balance between research
        and experementation.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;width: 50%;margin: auto;"><b>My Hobbies</b></h2>
    <p class="text_box">
        I like most of the steriotypical things, television, video games, reading, etc. Video games were a major part of my childhood, I consider 
        Minecraft to be the thing that got me into computers and programing through redstone (an in game circuit system), so i feel that goes to 
        show how influential video gaming has been for me. Although, in recent years I've made less time for it which is something I'd like to 
        correct soon, although given my affinity for constantly starting overly ambitious projects I wouldnt put money on it.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;width: 50%;margin: auto;"><b>Media I Like</b></h2>
    <p class="text_box">
        Like I said before I enjoy television and reading, but I've a particular fondness for sifi, which, given what I've previosly written, probably
        doesnt come as much of a surprise.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;width: 50%;margin: auto;"><b>Future Plans</b></h2>
    <p class="text_box">
        I'm hoping to colaborate with fudge-cake on a package in R for performing functional data analysis.<br>
        I'm also hoping to write a javascript library for a vector based graphics system to support a project theat involves teaching
        mathematical concepts through websites(but agian this one is on the back burner so please don't expect anything any time soon).
